What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The purpose of this Git repository was to privately submit code for assignments and labs for Comp20 Web Programming class at Tufts University. 


What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was the mbta station tracking map. It was my first assignment that I really felt a lot of accomplishment completing. I enjoyed using an API for the first time and I also thought that the detailed distance calculation to each station was a good use of math within programming.
